    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken thighs are so versatile and healthy. This delicious main dish can be ready in just about 35 minutes. <br> To complete the menu, serve with roasted potatoes and green beans, or a salad.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1½ pounds boneless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>8 ounces white mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, smashed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon herbes de Provence</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, cut crosswise into 6 rings</li>
        <li>½ cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>snipped fresh chives or parsley for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)</li>
        <li>Pat thighs dry with paper towels. Combine garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. <br> Sprinkle seasoning on both sides of the chicken thighs.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a 12-inch nonstick oven-safe skillet over medium heat. <br> Swirl the pan to coat the bottom with the hot oil. <br> Place seasoned thighs in the skillet and cook until browned, about 3 minutes. Turn thighs and brown
            the other side, about 2 minutes. <br> Transfer browned thighs to a plate and keep warm.
        </li>
        <li>Add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the same skillet. <br> Add mushrooms; cook and stir for about 2 minutes. <br> Add smashed garlic cloves and herbes de Provence; cook and stir for 1 more minute.
        </li>
        <li>Move mushrooms to one side of the skillet and place 3 onion rings into the skillet. <br> Place a browned chicken thigh on top of each onion slice. <br> Move mushrooms to create an empty space in the skillet, and place the remaining onion rings
            and chicken thighs in the skillet.
        </li>
        <li>When all the onion rings and chicken thighs are placed, redistribute the mushrooms <br> evenly around the skillet. Pour white wine over top and cover.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer skillet to the preheated oven and bake until chicken thighs are no longer <br> pink in the center and the juices run clear, 15 to 20 minutes. <br> An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F
            (74 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>Serve each chicken piece with a slice of the cooked onion and some mushrooms. <br> Garnish with snipped chives or parsley.
        </li>
    </ol>
